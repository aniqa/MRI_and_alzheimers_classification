# MRI_and_alzheimers_classification

We propose and compare various machine learning models to diagnose changes in brain structure as noted on Magnetic Resonance Images for Alzheimer
s Disease patients. Particularly, we have made the use of transfer learning through a high performing Deep Net model called ResNet50, which has previously performed well on medical image data. Additionally, we proposed to train on additional publicly available datasets, such as from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to improve the accuracy of our model.
