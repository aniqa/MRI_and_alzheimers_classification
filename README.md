# MRI_and_alzheimers_classification

We propose and compare various machine learning models to diagnose changes in brain structure as noted on Magnetic Resonance Images for Alzheimer
s Disease patients. Additionally, we proposed to train on additional publicly available datasets, such as from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to improve the accuracy of our model.
